## How to use:

* This demo supports English and Arabic.
* This demo relies on your phone language being English.
* This demo switches to Arabic automatically at the beginnig.
* Notice how the top-most label is correctly localized, but the others aren't.
* The next run everything will work OK (because the actual app language is then Arabic). Delete the app to re-create the experiment.
